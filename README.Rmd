### Description

This site provides a *quick* foundation in using the [R programming
language](https://www.r-project.org/) for data analytics. It is designed
to be self-taught as preparation for other courses that build on the
concepts covered. Topics include:

  - Data input/output
  - External packages
  - Data structures (vectors, data frames, lists)
  - Data wrangling
  - Data visualization
  - Reproducible reporting

### Acknowledgments

This course was inspired by many other courses / resources that cover
similar material - see the course [about
page](http://jhelvy.github.io/r4aPrimer/about.html) for more details.
