# Install R and RStudio

- [Download and install R](https://cloud.r-project.org) (version 4.0.2 or higher)
- [Download and install RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (Desktop version)

**We will always work in RStudio**, so be careful to open RStudio and not the default R application that comes with R:

<div style="width:200px">
Open this   | Not this!
:----------:|:----------:

</div>

## RStudio in the browser!

If you're having trouble installing R or RStudio, don't worry - you can quickly launch a _virtual_ version of RStudio in your webbrowser! Click on the <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> logo in the menu bar and log in with your GWU web ID and password.

**Note**: You must be on the GW network for this to work. If you're off campus, you can get on the network remotely using a [VPN](https://seascf.seas.gwu.edu/vpn-access). You can do that by installing the "Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client" software and logging in to GW's VPN:

- Install [Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client](https://my.gwu.edu/mod/downloads/?category=VPN)
- Follow [these instructions](https://gwu-myit.onbmc.com/dwp/app/#/knowledge/KBA00002611/rkm) to log on to the VPN with your GW NetID
