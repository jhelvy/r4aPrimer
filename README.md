**Description**:

This site provides a foundation in using the [R programming
language](https://www.r-project.org/) for data analytics. It is designed
to be self-taught as preparation for other courses that build on the
concepts covered. Topics include:

  - Data input/output
  - External packages
  - Data structures (vectors, data frames, lists)
  - Data wrangling
  - Data visualization
  - Reproducible reporting

For more details, please see the [course
website](https://jhelvy.github.io/r4aPrimer/).

**Learning Objectives**:

After completing these lessons, you should be able to:

  - Use RStudio to write basic R commands.
  - Know the distinctions between different R operators and data types,
    including numeric, string, and logical data.
  - Use **tidyverse** functions to wrangle and manipulate data in R.
  - Use the **ggplot2** library to create plots in R.
  - Reproducibly import, export, wrangle, and visualize data.

**Prerequisites**:

There are no prerequisites. Students are assumed to have zero prior
programming experience for this course.
